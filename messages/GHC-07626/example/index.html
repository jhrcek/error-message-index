<p>This error occurs because we havenâ€™t properly pattern matched on the list in our definition of the <code>merge</code> function. In particular, the parentheses are missing. The type here is a list, which means our options are to match on either the empty list, <code>[]</code>, or a list with head and tail, <code>(a:as)</code>. By omitting the parentheses around <code>a:as</code>, the compiler reads this as an argument, <code>a</code>, followed by a misplaced infix cons <code>(:)</code> operator, rather than considering the <code>:</code> to be part of the list being matched.</p>
