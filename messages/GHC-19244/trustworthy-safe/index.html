<p>In this example the module was annotated as trustworthy, but GHC inferred that the module is also safe.
Since “safe” is a stronger guarantee than “trustworthy”, GHC warns that the module should be annotated as safe instead.
The warning can therefore be fixed by changing the annotation from trustworthy to safe.</p>

    ‘TrustworthySafe’ is marked as Trustworthy but has been inferred as safe!
