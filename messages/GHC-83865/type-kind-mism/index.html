<p>Forgetting the type parameter to <code>Maybe</code> is the culprit, but it is only caught in the
context of the the arrow in the declaration of <code>isNothing</code>, which can be confusing.
The arrow (<code>-&gt;</code>) in Haskell is a <em>type constructor</em>. It takes two types
of <em>kind</em> <code>Type</code>, and returns a fresh type, also of kind <code>Type</code>. That is, for <code>x -&gt; y</code>
to make any sense, GHC needs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to be types of kind <code>Type</code>, which is not
the case in this example: <code>Maybe</code> by itself has kind <code>Type -&gt; Type</code>.</p>
<p>If you ever need to know the kind of something, you can ask <code>ghci</code>
with the <code>:kind</code> (or its shorthand <code>:k</code>), keeping in mind
that <code>*</code> (pronounced “star”) is a synonym for <code>Type</code>:</p>
<pre><code>ghci&gt; :k (-&gt;)
(-&gt;) :: * -&gt; * -&gt; *
ghci&gt; :k Maybe
Maybe :: * -&gt; *</code></pre>
